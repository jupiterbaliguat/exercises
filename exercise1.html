    <h2>Mandaue City allocates more funds to repair damaged classrooms</h2>
    <p>
        MANDAUE CITY, Philippines — Mandaue City has allocated an additional P17 million for the repair of public schools in the city damaged by super typhoon Odette.
    </p>
    <p>
        City Councilor Malcolm Sanchez, chairman of the committee on education, said that the additional P17 million and the P20 million that was earlier allocated by the city for the restoration of the damaged schools were from the Special Education Fund (SEF).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sanchez said initially the P20 million can only cover the repair of the 19 schools which were severely damaged by the typhoon that hit Cebu in December 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
        These 19 schools include Pagsabungan Elementary School and National High School.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Sanchez said Mayor Jonas Cortes decided to allot additional funds to hopefully fasten the repair.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, some schools’ stakeholders cannot repair their donated buildings yet. Also, the DepEd-Mandaue has yet to receive funds from the DepEd national for the school repair.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Committee on Education Chairman said the rehabilitation has already started depending on the program of work of each school.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few schools in the city have implemented emergency sessions or two sessions a day because of the lack of classrooms. The first session begins from 6 a.m to 12 p.m while the second session is from 12 p.m to 6 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others have also divided some of their bigger classrooms to accommodate two sections.

    <h2>Region 7 remains free of monkeypox</h2>
    <p>
        CEBU CITY, Philippines – Central Visayas remains free of monkeypox, the regional bureau of the Department of Health (DOH-7) announced.
    </p>
    <p>
        DOH-7, in a press conference on Tuesday, July 26, said that the region, and the entire country for that matter, has no confirmed cases of monkeypox.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, cluster head of the Regional Epidemiological and Surveillance Unit (Resu-7), said they detected two suspected cases of the viral infection in Bohol and Cebu provinces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, the two patients tested negative of the virus that causes monkeypox upon confirmation through laboratory tests.
    </p>
    <p>
        “We have suspected cases of monkeypox, one in Bohol and one here in Cebu, a week ago. However, all of them are negative,” said Cañal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cañal told the media that they received reports from barangay health workers (BHWs) in Bohol that a resident there showed symptoms of the infection.
    </p>
    <p>
        “We also received information from hospital workers in Cebu that one of their patients also exhibited symptoms. When we conducted further confirmatory tests, they yielded negative results,” she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
        Monkeypox was recently declared a “public health emergency of international concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO).
    </p>
    <p>
        A viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970, monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first symptoms of monkeypox are fever, headaches, muscle pain and back pain during the course of five days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rashes subsequently appear on the face, palms of hands and soles of the feet, followed by lesions, spots and finally scabs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The illness usually lasts two to four weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The virus can spread through direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs or body fluids; respiratory secretions during prolonged, face-to-face contact, or during intimate physical contact, or touching items such as clothing or linen that previously touched the infectious rash or body fluids. / with reports from INQUIRER.net
